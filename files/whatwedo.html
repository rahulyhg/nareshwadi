<h2>What We Do</h2>
<p>The GVET &ndash; WEIF partnership began in March 2010 with the following focus areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expanding access to quality education for underprivileged children</li>
<li>Improvement in child health</li>
<li>Capacity building in gender</li>
<li>GVET&rsquo;s sustainability, and</li>
<li>Strengthening Nareshwadi&rsquo;s capacity for effective programming.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Expanding access to quality education for underprivileged children</strong></p>
<p>As its first intervention, WEIF supported the construction of a dedicated classroom for the 9<sup>th</sup> grade, This has enabled NLC to accommodate 69 children (37 boys and 32 girls) to prepare for the matriculation exam.</p>
<p>WEIF also provided support to purchase a small generator for the general hostel building accommodating the girls&rsquo; and the boys&rsquo; residences, the kitchen and dining halls as there is daily power outage.</p>
<p>For 2012-13 WEIF provided sponsorships for children completing their matriculation with high scores&nbsp; securing admission for higher education. One of the girls from Divshi, whose parents are migrant construction labour, is doing her first year engineering in electronics in Mumbai. The child who designed NLC&rsquo;s logo, an orphan, is completing his diploma in welding and fabrication in June 2013 and will soon undertake his apprenticeship in a major manufacturing company in Mumbai.</p>
<p><strong>Improvement in child health</strong></p>
<p>WEIF provided funding to start the school dairy with 5 cows. The milk is included in the children&rsquo;s daily diet resulting in improved health.</p>
<p><strong>Capacity building in gender sensitivity</strong></p>
<p>WEIF supported GVET to integrate gender in its programming through building the capacity of teachers in gender sensitive approaches. Two teachers, one female and one male, were deputed for a month&rsquo;s intensive training in gender and development at Visthar (<a href="http://www.visthar.org/">www.visthar.org</a>) in June 2011. They in turn conducted workshops for NLC&rsquo;s teachers and staff and village school teachers, to develop a gender sensitive approach to teaching.</p>
<p><strong>GVET&rsquo;s sustainability</strong></p>
<p>WEIF has been engaged with GVET over building its capacity to generate revenues to meet some of its operational budget. As a start, a pilot project of 10 bee boxes were installed in the school farm. The pilot apiary project did well generating excellent quality honey in the first year. However, the bee colonies disappeared and it is said that the proliferation of mobile towers in the region is the cause of this.</p>
<p><strong>Strengthening NLC&rsquo;s admin capacity</strong></p>
<p>Long hours of power outage creates disruption in day to day functioning. NLC staff were unable to complete their work on time. WEIF provided inverters to the accounts and admin office, the school office and teachers room which has enabled work to be completed on time.&nbsp;</p>
