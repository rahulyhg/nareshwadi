<h2>About</h2>
<p>Nareshwadi Learning Centre (NLC)is run by the Girivanvasi Educational Trust (GVET) on an 12 acre campus in the lush green environs of the Nareshwadi experimental farm located in Dundhalwadi Group Grampanchayat, Dahanu Taluka, Thane District, about 130 km from Mumbai, Maharashtra, India. The NLC comprises the Leelaben Kotak Primary School, K J Somaiya Secondary School,&nbsp; the Vocational Education and Training Centre (VETC), the General Hostel for girls and boys, the Children&rsquo;s Home approved by the Woman &amp; Child Welfare Department of the Government of Maharashtra, the School Farm and Dairy. The NLC campus is surrounded by paddy fields and a fruit orchard abundant with mango, coconut and chickoo (sapota) trees, contributing to an ambience of spontaneous creativity and learning.</p>
<p>Children admitted to Nareshwadi are from underprivileged families, aged 5 plus to 17 years. Ninety per cent of&nbsp;them are from the local Warli tribal community with a few Kokanas, Katkari and Dodhi. About ten per cent are children of single or no parents, HIV infected and affected.</p>
<p>Over the past three years NLC has been closely engaged with the community as part of its outreach programme. This has created a keen interest in children to undertake development projects in their villages. NLC, in partnership with its sister institution the Girvanvasi Pragati Mandal, conducts training workshops for the children&rsquo;s families and communities to start income generating activities in their own villages to curb&nbsp; migration.</p>
<p>All &nbsp;Nareshwadi staff from teachers, administrators, house parents (caretakers), school counsellor, school nurses, sports coaches, the experimental farm staff and instructors of the VETC work together to create a&nbsp;conducive learning environment, where children can hone their multiple intelligences and give of their best.&nbsp;</p>
